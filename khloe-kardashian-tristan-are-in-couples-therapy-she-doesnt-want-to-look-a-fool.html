It was the dumbest kind of humble-brag too, because it involved her relationship with Tristan Thompson, the man who repeatedly cheated on her during her pregnancy. Khloe is still with Tristan and she’s pretending that everything is totally fine and that they are an amazing little family unit. Her humble-brag, weeks ago, was <a href=#>that she’s “proud” of the strength she’s shown</a>, because apparently it takes a lot of strength to stay with a cheater. Well, now someone in the Kardashian camp is spilling the tea on what’s going on with Khloe and Tristan behind-the-scenes.</p><p>Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are turning to a professional to help them work out their issues. Lisa Stanley, a longtime friend of Kris Jenner, opened up about the couple’s relationship following Thompson’s cheating scandal in April days before their daughter was born, saying, Khloé would never leave him.</p><p>“She doesn’t want to look a fool. She was a fool once with Lamar [Odom], and she didn’t want to do it again,” Stanley told KIIS FM’s Celeb HQ on Monday.</p><p>To help move on from the scandal, they’ve sought out couples therapy.</p><p>“One thousand percent they are working through couples therapy. She’s working hard, he’s working hard,” she shared. “You can’t just earn trust back in two months.”</p><p>Although Khloé’s family wanted her to leave Thompson, Stanley said that would never happen.</p><p>“Khloé was always going to try and make this work, for a plethora of reasons. The first reason is she has a child now, and she feels very connected to [Tristan] in that way,” she said. “The second reason is she loves him. She clearly loves the man.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>“She doesn’t want to look a fool”?? So she’s staying with a guy who was clearly trying to force her hand and get her to dump him? She doesn’t want to look like a fool… when I guarantee that the headline seven months from now will be “Tristan caught in flagrante with girl he met on Instagram.” But sure, there’s nothing wrong with couples therapy. I still think Khloe is delusional AF though.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/BGUS_1268537_0092.jpg alt="Tristan Thompson takes Khloe Kardashian to Joey Restaurant" width=480 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Backgrid.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbnBlZYN4e8qho6idj6Cus7DArJ%2BimZ6UwbO10q2Yp5eRp7Kgtc2YmqitoKGytKvToZyrmaCurLS0xJibqJ2jo8Ggw8Cnq5isn5S5sLvKmJiYnp%2BkuXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luke-combs-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Luke Combs Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mediocre-miami-qb-ryan-tannehill-will-end-up-making-way-more-money-than-dan-marino-from-the-nfl.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mediocre Miami QB Ryan Tannehill Will End Up Making WAY More Money Than Dan Marino From The NFL</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-summers-eve-wash-bad-for-you-html.html>Is Summer's Eve Wash Bad For You?
