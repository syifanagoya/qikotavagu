The 24-year-old just posted a picture on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, and her nearly 12 million followers voiced their approval. Sweeney plays the oh-so-dramatic Cassie Howard on the hit HBO series alongside Zendaya, which just wrapped its second season. It seems fitting, then, that she would choose to wear an equally dramatic Miu Miu custom-made gown.</p><p>Although Sydney Sweeney didn’t say exactly why she was dressed to the nines, a little detective work revealed the reason. Sweeney, as well as other members of the Euphoria cast, attended the Vanity Fair After-Oscar Party, according to Australia’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vogue Magazine</a>. Her dress, with a crystal-embedded v-neck bodice and pale lavender skirt, became the talk of fashion Twitter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Sadly, Sydney Sweeney did not get to go to the Oscars. The awards ceremony is an invitation-only event, and the cast of Emmy-winning shows are often overlooked. In fact, Zendaya and Jacob Elordi (who is now starring in the Ben Affleck drama Deep Water) were the only cast members to attend the Oscars. The cast, however, chose to reunite for the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, where Sweeney was joined by Euphoria stars Alexa Demie, Hunter Schafer, Barbie Ferreira, Maude Apatow, Dominic Fike and Angus Cloud.</p><p>Although most people recognize Sydney Sweeney from Euphoria, she actually has a number of major credits in her short career, with some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. At the age of 12, she appeared in a bit role on the NBC smash hit Heroes, and soon after appeared on shows including Grey’s Anatomy, 90210, Pretty Little Liars, and Criminal Minds. She played Emaline Addario on the 90’s-era series Everything Sucks! for Netflix, and then bigger projects came calling.</p><p>2018 was a big year for Sydney Sweeney, as she appeared as Alice on the HBO miniseries Sharp Objects with Amy Adams and as Eden on Hulu’s hit series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Handmaid’s Tale</a> with Elisabeth Moss. She even appeared with Spider-Man Andrew Garfield in Under the Silver Lake and in the horror flick Along Came the Devil. In 2019, she appeared as Snake, one of Charles Manson’s girls, in Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood and the series The White Lotus. Superstardom would come for Sydney Sweeney that year, however, when she was cast in Euphoria. Her biggest projects, however, may be yet to come.</p><p>Sydney Sweeney is officially becoming a part of the Marvel mythos with a role in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madame Web</a>, a Spider-Man spinoff from Sony. We don’t know exactly who she will play, but Dakota Johnson has signed on for the leading role. Fans, however, have been rallying online for Sweeney to play Spider-Gwen, a character which could be introduced via the Multiverse, after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home. Someone even managed to create <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fan-art</a> envisioning Sweeney in costume, and MCU fans couldn’t get enough of it. Her Instagram post confirming the casting was coy about her role, as she only included a spider emoji as a caption with an image of a headline.</p><p>On a personal note, Sydney Sweeney was recently engaged to actor Jonathan Davino, according to a report from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>. A wedding date has not been set. Sweeney tends to keep her personal life off of her social media, but E! is speculating that the couple might relocate from Los Angeles to Davino’s home town of Chicago after they wed, as the pair has been spending a lot of time there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno66xr7HYZqqwnZWjsrp50p6cZqyYp7y2s8dmm6udo6h7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lee-boo-jin-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lee Boo-Jin Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alana-zimmer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alana Zimmer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-summers-eve-wash-bad-for-you-html.html>Is Summer's Eve Wash Bad For You?
