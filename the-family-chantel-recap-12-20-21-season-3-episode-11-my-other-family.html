They all put on swimsuits and they went to the beach. They couldn’t wait to put their troubles behind them, but curiosity won out and they asked Chantel how the meeting with her mother-in-law went. It did not go well. Chantel tried to get answers for Pedro. She asked Lidia about her relationship with Pedro Senior.</p><p>She asked her if she loved him and Lidia didn’t think she did. She said she never loved Pedro’s father. She laughed at Pedro’s pain. She refuses to understand how traumatizing to know his father was capable of being a great father and chose not to be one to either him or his sister. Pedro’s sister at least understand somewhat. She too was hurt by their father not being in her life and still she wouldn’t fully support her brother.</p><p>Pedro told her that he wanted to meet the other side of the family. He said it was important to him to meet his half-siblings and Nicole didn’t agree with the idea. She refuses to meet them. She doesn’t even want to seek out their dad and so Nicole while hurt was ready to close the book on it. She didn’t want answers while Pedro did. Pedro later met with his half-siblings. He met Junior and Jonathan. He said his brother Junior looks exactly like his sister. They were just white while he was black. His brothers also discussed their father and they said their father was strict. He was always on them to do the right thing and so they never suspected he had another family. That had seemed implausible to them until he admitted the truth.</p><p>Pedro’s brother Junior found out about him because he found a letter that Lidia sent. Lidia tried to get Pedro Senior active in his children’s life and he was resisting and arguing with her. Lidia probably never revealed that to her children because she hadn’t wanted to further hurt them. But this put Pedro’s heart at ease. He knows now that his mother tried to get his father to participate in his life and that she wasn’t as cold-hearted as she appeared. Lidia did care. She was just hurt, too. Pedro now feels better about his mother and that turned out to be an issue with his wife. Chantel still hasn’t forgiven Lidia for the many things that went wrong in her relationship with her. And she couldn’t bury it.</p><p>Chantel tried to bury it. Only she kept going back to being on guard with Lidia and she sometimes forgets to support her husband and that’s why she originally came down to the DR. He asked for support. She said she’d stop by to be there for him and then she forgot why she went. Pedro returned from the lunch with his brothers in a better mood. He was ready to forgive his mother and he said as much to Chantel but Chantel then reminded him of the problematic things that Lidia has done as well as said and Pedro chose to get mad at her rather than at Lidia. Lidia was the one who still welcomed Pedro’s father into her bed even after he refuses to have a relationship with his children. And so a simple letter asking him to be there for kids wasn’t enough.</p><p>Not to Chantel. Chantel tried to tell Pedro that Lidia had other options and that she didn’t pursue them because she didn’t put her children first. Its as simple as that. Pedro didn’t want to hear it. He told Chantel to go back to the States and she said she would. Pedro later tried to call his father. His father didn’t answer the phone and that made Pedro doubt himself again. He got his father’s phone number from his brothers. He thought they might have told their dad that Pedro would call and that’s why his father didn’t answer. His father could also not have picked up because he didn’t recognize the phone number. He might have seen an United States number as a scam. There were plenty of possibilities and Pedro was plagued by all of them.</p><p>Back in the States, River was regretting his newest song. His song was about his new girlfriend Megan and how he was falling in love with her and she wasn’t at the same place he was. Megan was still reeling from being told she hadn’t showed up as much of him in this relationship. She thought she was giving it her all and the fact that wasn’t enough for River made her realize that she probably doesn’t have more to give. Megan and River had a frank conversation. She confessed to needing to step back and River was hurt. He realized that she wasn’t as into the relationship as he was. He was left feeling hurt. He truly does care about Megan, but he wasn’t her first priority and he needs to find that in a potentially new relationship.</p><p>Pedro meanwhile went to his mother’s place. He asked her about the letter. She denied ever sending a letter. He asked her if she loved his father and she said she never did. Pedro stormed out. He called his brother to ask about the letter and he again said a letter was sent to his father to be there for his kids. But it didn’t have any names on it. Pedro’s stepmother also destroyed the letter out of hurt and anger and so now Pedro doesn’t know who to believe.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWpnpJ2ybrLApqClsV2YtaK6056jZqqVmK6xeZBrZGtoXWd%2Bbr%2FEmqqopl1oeqa8yKymnZ1dZn5uudhmpq2glad6p63MoqOyZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-robin-roberts-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Robin Roberts Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steeltown-murders-review-dna-drama-rightly-pulls-focus-from-the-saturday-night-strangler.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steeltown Murders Review: DNA Drama Rightly Pulls Focus From the 'Saturday Night Strangler'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-summers-eve-wash-bad-for-you-html.html>Is Summer's Eve Wash Bad For You?
