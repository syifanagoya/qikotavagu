The "47 Meters Down" is a perfect example of this genre.</p><p class=dh>The 2017 film delivers an exciting experience to viewers, complete with jump-scares that keep them on the edge of their seats, wondering if the characters will survive their terrifying encounter with apex predators.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/6471027ead3db306514d80af8bb2b854701518992b551dcdf96a635c98ed713e.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Claire Holt and Mandy Moore attend the "47 Meters Down" premiere at The Regency Village Theatre on June 12, 2017, in Westwood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Why Movies about Sharks Captivate Audiences</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>These films are popular as they bring a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vox.com/summer-movies/2017/6/16/15819110/why-we-love-shark-movies>sense of excitement</a> to film enthusiasts. Even though they often stretch reality and repeat similar plots, these aquatic villains thrill moviegoers for a few simple reasons.</p><p class=dh>On-screen, sharks make startling appearances through the use of special effects. Additionally, the idea that sharks may possess greater intelligence than humans and might seek revenge makes the stories more intriguing.</p><p class=dh>What makes these movies stand out is their adaptability. Unlike other horror creatures, sharks can engage in epic battles with other animals and even team up with them, resulting in unexpected combinations.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Is '46 Meters Down' All About?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>"<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2932536/>47 Meters Down</a>" is one of the many films offering horror, mystery, and <a class="me a" href=#>survival themes</a> under the open water. Its <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddYSGGJAKOk">trailer</a> is about two sisters, Lisa, played by <a class="me a" href=#>Mandy Moore</a>, and Kate, portrayed by Claire Holt, who go on a vacation to Mexico.</p><p class=dh>The 2017 film, directed by Johannes Roberts and Ernest Riera, follows the siblings trying cage diving with sharks for an adrenaline rush. However, their excitement turns terrifying as the cable holding their enclosure suddenly snaps, sending them over 40 meters to the ocean floor.</p><p class=dh>Trapped in shark-infested waters, the siblings must face a daunting challenge: to overcome physical limitations, fears, and anxieties to make it out of the surface before their oxygen runs out. All the while, they must deal with the constant threat of sharks lurking in the darkness.</p><p class=dh>In addition to Moore and Holt, the film features a talented ensemble cast, including <a class="me a" href=#>Matthew Modine</a>, Chris Johnson, Yani Gellman, Santiago Segura, Mayra Juarez, and Axell Mansilla. The film later earned a sequel in 2019, "47 Meters Down: Uncaged."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/0ef255733707363a2bb24f8e069a9fa53a295033f19bee90ac9da887c727d12f.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Chris Johnson, Santiago Segura, Claire Holt, Matthew Modine, director Johannes Roberts, Mandy Moore, and Yani Gellman attend the "47 Meters Down" premiere at Regency Village Theatre on June 12, 2017, in Westwood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Is '47 Meters Down' Based on a True Story?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Although "47 Meters Down" is <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://thecinemaholic.com/is-47-meters-down-based-on-a-true-story/>not based</a> on a true story, shark attacks on humans happen. However, these real-life incidents are usually quite different from the dramatic scenes depicted in the movie.</p><p class=dh>Most attacks happen near the shore or in the surf zone, and such cases are extremely rare. However, there have been occasions when divers have <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.trackingsharks.com/first-fatal-shark-attack-of-2023/>encountered sharks</a>, leading to harrowing situations reminiscent of the events depicted in the film.</p><p class=dh>Tragically, in January 2023, Manuel Lopez lost his life while collecting mollusks in Tobari Bay, Mexico. The turbulence created during the mollusk collection may have drawn the attention of sharks.</p><p class=dh>Despite being warned about the presence of sharks in the area, Lopez still dived due to the economic pressures stemming from a seafood shortage. This incident was not an isolated occurrence.</p><p class=dh>In 2022, another diver, Victor Estrella, faced a similar fate under comparable circumstances. In 2018, a man named Nahum Aguilera also died after a shark attacked him shortly after jumping into the water.</p><p class=dh>Despite sharks often being portrayed as on-screen antagonists, wildlife experts emphasize that most shark encounters result from mistaken identity and that sharks are not inherently dangerous to humans.</p><p class=dh>Biologist and wildlife conservationist Jeff Corwin said sharks serve as indicators of a "vibrant, resilient ecosystem," serving as crucial barometers in the world. Corwin <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shark-attacks-2023-states-most-bites-experts-explain/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"We need sharks.

It tells us something's awry when we lose our sharks."</p><p class=dh>Lauren Gaches, director of public affairs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries, said that sharks play an essential role in the food web, helping maintain balance in the ocean's ecosystem.</p><p class=dh>Gaches also emphasized their dedication to protecting shark populations by actively engaging in research, collaborating closely with fishermen, and implementing crucial measures such as harvest restrictions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1obGlmbnqqv4xtbmallamys7%2BMnaawpl2WerW%2B1J5krKyfp8ZuvsSao2akmZuyb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mia-scholink-joel-courtney-girlfriend-turned-fiance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mia Scholink Joel Courtney Girlfriend Turned Fiance</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-billy-york-lane-everything-about-the-ex-husband-of-betty-lou-beets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Billy York Lane?
