That became a huge meme as well, but all of those exciting finishers took a toll on his body.</p><p>During a recent episode of<a href=#> The Extreme Life of Matt Hardy</a> podcast, the topic of discussion turned to The Hardy’s physical condition compared to their previous encounter with The Young Bucks in 2017. Matt Hardy was then asked if he noticed significant changes in their bodies.</p><p>Matt Hardy then shared that he has been focusing on enhancing his balance. Then he shifted the topic over to something that Randy Orton once told him.</p><p>According to Matt Hardy, Randy expressed how the continuous execution of his signature RKO finisher had taken a toll on his body.</p><p>Yes, it has, it has (our bodies changed between ROH Ladder match in 2017 & Double or Nothing 2022 versus Young Bucks) and there’s some things… Once again, it’s very weird, as you get older, it’s just like you have to change things to keep your body in a certain condition and I’m constantly in a process of changing things. I actually had a lot of people that complimented the stuff at Double or Nothing and I’ve been doing a lot of balance training, as crazy as that sounds.</p><p>I’ve been doing balance training because just like, I had a long conversation with Randy Orton. He was talking about how messed up his body was just from doing the RKO over and over and over again and you know, I told him, ‘You can only imagine how my hips and lower back feel after all those leg drops over all the years’ but he was just talking about how bad his balance was, that he didn’t realize and that kind of got me thinking and I’ve done more balance training than anything else recently and I feel like it’s helped me on my movement and whatnot and hopefully my flexibility.</p><p>It has been more than a year since Randy Orton’s last match. He had to undergo back fusion surgery. His father, ‘Cowboy’ Bob Orton Jr., suggesting that doctors have advised Randy to refrain from wrestling as well.</p><p>Randy Orton’s WWE return is in the works. Ringside News exclusively reported that his return to the ring is planned, but it won’t happen this Summer. That being said, fans can expect to see him again in 2023.</p><p>What’s your take on Randy Orton’s career in WWE?
