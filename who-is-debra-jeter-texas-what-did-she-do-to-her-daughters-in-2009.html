I just killed my children.”&nbsp;Jeter was totally composed, temporarily losing her cool when the dispatcher asked for her name. Debra said that one of her children was alive and the other was ‘asking to be saved.’ Jeter continued:</p><p>“I’m in the house walking around and um, one of them is still alive for real. She is asking to be saved and I couldn’t handle that.”&nbsp;Debra was a trained nurse, and rather than tend to her daughter, she hounded the dispatcher for an ambulance.&nbsp;“Hold on kid, they’re coming,”&nbsp;Debra told her older daughter Kiersten.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Debra_Jeta_Texas_sentence></span>Debra Jeta Texas sentence<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After slitting the throats of both of her daughters in a run-down house near Interstate 77 in Hillsboro, Texas, Debra Jeter was given a life sentence.</p><p>On June 5, 2009, Debra Jeter, then 32, killed both of her children by slitting their throats in an abandoned home near Interstate 77 in Hillsboro, Texas.</p><p>Similar to this, Debra Jeter was treated for her mental health issues and the case against her was dropped after she was charged with physically assaulting her older daughter, Kiersten, in 2004.</p><p>According to reports, Jeter appeared to be in trouble and asked the 911 operator for an ambulance. On the 911 tape, Jeter could be heard offering comfort while the severely injured daughter cried out for help inside the abandoned home.</p><p>The murderous instrument of choice was a knife. Jeter turned herself in to police after killing her younger daughter and appeared to understand what had happened.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_To_Debra_Jeter%E2%80%99s_Daughters></span>What Happened To Debra Jeter’s Daughters?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After being released from the hospital, <a href=# rel=noopener>Debra</a> made arrangements to see her two daughters. She drove them to an abandoned home off Interstate 77 near Route 35 in Milford.</p><p>According to reports, Jeter began by stabbing Kiersten with a knife. As she resisted her mother, Kiersten yelled for her sister to run away. As a result, Debra’s attention shifted from Kiersten to Kelsey.</p><p>Kiersten was stabbed in the back while attempting to protect her sister. Kelsey tragically died in the bathroom of the abandoned house after Debra cut her neck.</p><p>Debra also went back to Kiersten and slashed her across the neck, severing one of her major arteries and her airway.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Debra_Jeter%E2%80%99s_Husband_Lester_Lee_Jeter></span>Debra Jeter’s Husband Lester Lee Jeter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Debra’s husband, Lester Lee Jeter, filed for divorce in May 2009 for unspecified reasons.</p><p>According to sources, Debra made an attempt on suicide on May 22 in front of her two children with Lester Jeter as a way of expressing her unhappiness with the split. Debra spent a brief period of time in a mental health facility.</p><p>In addition, while Debra was still in the hospital, her husband filed for divorce, obtained a temporary restraining order, and was given temporary custody of his two kids.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Debra_took_a_plea_deal_that_gave_her_life_without_parole></span>Debra took a plea deal that gave her life without parole<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The neighborhood found it difficult to comprehend Debra’s brutality toward her children. She had not previously demonstrated such levels of violence.</p><p>Debra was accused of murder and a capital murder attempt by the prosecution. Her bond was set by the court at $1.5 million. The surgery went well for Kiersten, and four days later she was discharged from the intensive care unit.</p><p>The biggest question is, ‘Why?’”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sheriff Lyon said</a>. However, Debra declined to explain her motive to authorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Debra admitted guilt to both attempted and actual capital murder in May 2010. She pleaded guilty and was given life in prison without the possibility of parole; this likely spared her the death penalty and prevented Kiersten from testifying about the incident.</p><p>According to KWTX, Jeter apologized to Lee and Kiersten. Lee claimed that Debra admitted to still hating him but also expressed regret for the murder and violent assault.</p><p>Before being moved to a Gatesville prison facility run by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Kiersten reportedly joked around with Debra.</p><p>Debra allegedly admitted to Lester that she had attacked the kids to keep them from feeling the pain of the couple’s divorce and custody battle.</p><p>She wanted to end all of our suffering because she reasoned that if she felt that way, we must all feel that way, Lee said.</p><p>Lester claimed that Kiersten motivated him to continue the battle. Kiersten informed Lester that Kelly would not want them to give up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ecOemauZXZ%2BytbHRZquesJGoeri0wK1knaGUYsCpsYydpmasn2K1pr6MnZiun5ipsrO%2FjKKlZmpgZYZw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-cohen-confronts-kim-zolciak-thinks-shes-hiding-plastic-surgery-2015178.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andy Cohen Confronts Kim Zolciak, Thinks She's Hiding Plastic Surgery</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jared-padalecki-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jared Padalecki Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Wife, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-summers-eve-wash-bad-for-you-html.html>Is Summer's Eve Wash Bad For You?
