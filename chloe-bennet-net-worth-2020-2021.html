If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of&nbsp;Chloe&nbsp;Bennet’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Chloe Bennet was born on April 18, 1992, in Chicago, US. She is an American actress and pop singer. Her parents, Bennet Wang, were Chinese-American and worked as investment bankers while her mother, Stephanie Lynn Crane, was Caucasian-American. She has seven brothers, out of which four are biological, two are foster, and one is adopted.</p><p>Since her childhood, Chloe wanted to build her career in singing, so she released three singles. It wasn’t enough, so she started to build her career as an actor. She completed high school at St. Ignatius College, then moved to China at the age of 15 to pursue a career in music. There, Chloe lived with her parenteral grandmother in Shanghai and started her career as a pop singer. She has also learned Mandarin to excel her skills in singing.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Chloe Bennet is 27-year-old&nbsp;and&nbsp;isn’t married yet. However, she has been into a few relationships. Considering&nbsp;how beautiful and graceful she is, she steals the heart at first sight.&nbsp;Chloe&nbsp;first dated actor Tony Oller around 2011, but&nbsp;their&nbsp;relationship ended when in 2012,&nbsp;Chloe allegedly came into contact with Sam Palladio.</p><p>However, in&nbsp;2013, she found her new love,&nbsp;Austin Nichols.&nbsp;They&nbsp;remained together for four years, and in 2017,&nbsp;she met Logan Paul, and they dated until October 2018.

She is 1.67m tall and weighs 55 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Chloe Bennet was&nbsp;very&nbsp;passionate about singing since her childhood.&nbsp;So she&nbsp;gave wings to her dreams&nbsp;and&nbsp;went to China, and there started her singing career.&nbsp;Chloe’s&nbsp;debut single was ‘UH OH’ which she released in both&nbsp;Mandarin&nbsp;as well as in English. Then she released&nbsp;her second single ‘Every Day in Between’ but only in English.</p><p>These two songs earned her the ‘pop singer’ status, but she realized that singing was not for her, so she&nbsp;went&nbsp;to Los Angeles and tried her hands in&nbsp;acting in&nbsp;Hollywood. As she had already earned a bit of fame, hitting the road was not very difficult for her.</p><p>Chloe&nbsp;first appeared on the big screen as a host of ‘The Nightlife,’&nbsp;which was&nbsp;a TV dance series. In 2013,&nbsp;the&nbsp;most significant breakthrough of her career came when she&nbsp;played&nbsp;the role of ‘Skye’ in the TV series ‘Marvel’s Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.’&nbsp;After&nbsp;that, she&nbsp;has&nbsp;appeared in several TV shows such as ‘Jake and the never Pirates,’ ‘The birthday boys,’ and ‘Nashville.’</p><p>Chloe&nbsp;was also featured in a couple of films. However,&nbsp;in her&nbsp;initial days in Hollywood, she had to face problems due to her surname ‘Wang,’&nbsp;which is Asian,&nbsp;so she changed it to Bennet,&nbsp;who was&nbsp;her father’s first name.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Its not has been much time since&nbsp;Chloe has set&nbsp;her&nbsp;feet in Hollywood,&nbsp;and&nbsp;She has undoubtedly impressed the people but couldn’t bag any awards or significant achievements yet except for the nomination for the Kids’ Choice Award.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of&nbsp;Chloe Bennet&nbsp;in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Chloe-Bennet-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Achieving success in two different fields is never easy, both in singing and acting, but Chloe Bennet has done it.
