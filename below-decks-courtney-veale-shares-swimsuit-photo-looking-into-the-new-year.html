In a new social media post the Below Deck star shows off her amazing body in a bathing suit while on the beach. "Looking into the new year like‚Ä¶ ü•≥‚úàÔ∏èüëãüèΩPlus some moments from a wonderful first week of 2024," she captioned a series of snap highlighting her health habits, like eating lean protein and veggies and working out at the gym. How does the reality star approach health and wellness? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Fitness has always been a big part of my life. I feel like it's helped me mentally so much. It has such a good impact on my mental health, so that's why I really try and keep in a good routine," Courtney told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Closer</span></a><span>. She changes her workouts "depending on how I'm feeling," she explained. "I have a personal trainer two or three times a week with who I really like doing heavy weighted training, just because I feel like I can't really do that on my own," she said, adding that she hits the gym "like, five, six times a week," she revealed. "That does include either gyming on my own, or with one of my PTs. I'm not very good at doing cardio anymore, I get in there and the last thing I want to do is cardio, so I do more weight training."</span></p><p><span>"I also love yoga, focusing on my breathing and breathwork stretches," Courtney told Closer. "I go to yoga three times a week but I also try and do some yoga at home, especially in the mornings. Doing a stretching session after lifting heavy weights can be important, because you can kind of feel like you lack mobility after that, especially if you don't really stretch." There is a laundry list of reasons to do yoga, explains </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "Researchers found that people who practiced yoga for at least 30 minutes once a week for at least four years, gained less weight during middle adulthood," they said. "People who were overweight actually lost weight. Overall, those who practiced yoga had lower body mass indexes (BMIs) compared with those who did not practice yoga. Researchers attributed this to mindfulness. Mindful eating can lead to a more positive relationship with food and eating."</span></p><p><span>"I love going for walks and being outside, as well," Courtney told Closer. She also likes going on "little" runs. "I think walks are so beneficial, going for a walk is really underestimated. Sometimes the last thing I want to do when I wake up in the morning is go to the gym and if I am feeling that way, I'll just go for a walk. After I've had the fresh air and all the positivity has gone to my brain, I'm like 'maybe I will go to the gym.' Yeah, I feel like a walk is probably the most underestimated activity you can do."</span></p><p><span>You can't out exercise a bad diet, says Courtney. "Nutrition comes into it a lot, as well. If you try and fuel your body with good nourishing stuff, it's not as bad when you don't work out as much and you don't feel as guilty for it," she told Closer. "Cashew nuts are my go-to snack at the moment. I also love celery with soft cheese or hummus."</span></p><p><span>Courtney is "always stretching," she told Closer. You can find her "using booty bands and doing resistance band workouts in my cabin because you don't need a lot of space for that." "Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints," says </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><p><span>"I love reading at the moment, but I like to read while I walk. Nobody can get their head around it, but I literally love it!" Courtney confessed about her unique routine. One </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard study</span></a><span> published in Social Science & Medicine found that people who read books regularly had a 20% lower risk of dying over the next 12 years compared with people who weren't readers or who read periodicals.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKOxy6iuZpyVmLi0ecKorKusnprGbsLEmqOeZaOdrrOx0maqsKGdqMKqwIypn6isn2K5sLvKoqWgZZmjwbB506GcZqaVrHq6scCrZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alana-zimmer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alana Zimmer</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kiss-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Prince Kiss lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-summers-eve-wash-bad-for-you-html.html>Is Summer's Eve Wash Bad For You?
