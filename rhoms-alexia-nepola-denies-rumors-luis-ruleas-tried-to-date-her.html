However, Alexia clarified during an episode of <a href=# rel=noopener>Watch What Happens Live</a> earlier this month that she had met Louie on a trip to Barcelona as they stayed in the same hotel.</p><p>“Whenever he did approach me, [it] was because he had watched me on the show and he knew <a href=#>my challenges with Frankie</a> and my journey with Frankie,” she explained to Us on Saturday. “And he can feel that pain as a father, ‘cause he is a very good father, and he has his autistic son, Nicholas. So, I think it was more that I was an inspiration to him, and he was so touched by the fact of meeting me and knowing, ‘God, we’re kind of in the same journey.’”</p><p>Alexia shares sons <a href=#>Peter</a>, 31, and Frankie, 26, with ex-husband <strong>Pedro Rosello</strong>. Frankie has lived with severe brain injuries since getting into a near-fatal car accident at the age of 13 in 2011. Louie is also a <a href=#>father of two boys</a>, sharing Nicholas, 21, and Louie Jr., 19, with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Marissa Dimartino Ruelas</strong></a>.</p><p>Alexia — who wed her husband, Todd, 50, in 2021 — went on to note that it can be tough for reality stars to know whether their romantic partners are pursuing relationships for the right reasons. “Are we always going to think that whatever man that comes next to us and wants to date us is because we’re known or we’re celebrities or whatever you want to call us?” she stated. “It’s just like the rich guy, like, is he going to think, ‘Oh, the woman’s only dating me because I have money, not because of who I am?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RHOM-Alexia-Nepola-Shuts-Down-Rumors-She-Dated-Teresa-Giudice-Husband-Luis-Ruelas.jpg><p>Despite that, Alexia said she wants to believe that <a href=#>Louie “really does love Teresa,”</a> adding, “She’s beautiful and she’s amazing, so, it’s like, why can’t he like her?” She continued: “People always want to focus [on], ‘Oh, he’s just looking for stardom or fame.’ So, I don’t agree with that. And there’s no truth to it, by the way.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Her celebrity status is something Alexia told Us she wasn’t worried about when it came to her romance with Todd. “When he met me, I wasn’t on TV. He did know that I had a show and he did know about my past, but I never thought, ‘Oh, he wants to date me at a TV show,’” she shared. “I’m like, ‘He wants to date me because the same, because I’m so fabulous. And of course, he’s going to fall in love with me.’”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroJ%2BiwG6ty56vopldo7Kxu8uaZJ2dnp6ytHnRrqSoqqNiuba10maprqSVlsBuwNGinJ1lpKR6pa3TnmShnaJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./marie-chantel-greece-online-social-media.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A thoroughly modern princess: Tech-savvy Marie-Chantal of Greece</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andrea-bocelli-surgery-and-health-update-lost-his-eye-sight-at-the-age-of-12.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Andrea Bocelli Surgery And Health Update: Lost His Eye Sight At The Age Of 12</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-summers-eve-wash-bad-for-you-html.html>Is Summer's Eve Wash Bad For You?
