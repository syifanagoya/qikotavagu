E! cancelled <a href=#>The Royals</a> in August after four seasons. While the show was being shopped around to other outlets in hopes of a pickup, that unfortunately never happened. The end was a bittersweet one for star <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Hurley</strong></a>, who played the queen of Engand.</p><p>“You know what? It was a great four years. It’s OK hanging [the tiara] up. But we had great fans, they call themselves the ‘loyals,’ and they were really good and really supportive,” Hurley, 53, told Us Weekly exclusively <a href=#>at Estee Lauder’s event to light the Empire State Building pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2018.</a> “All of the cast and crew became my mates and that was like my home. [The] saddest thing is them pulling down that set. It was a beautiful set. But all good things come to an end and it’ll be on to the next.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elizabeth-Hurley2.jpg><p>As for a future for The Royals, Hurley quipped, “never say never,” but reminded Us that the cast’s contracts are up. However, she does have some wishes on how she would have liked to see the series wrap.</p><p>“I know my daughter would have liked to be queen of England eventually. My little son, William, he wanted to be king of England. It could have ended in a lot of ways,” she told Us, adding that she keeps in touch with the cast, which included <strong>Alexandra Park</strong> and <strong>William Moseley</strong>. “Personally, I think I should’ve remained queen of England and just been in charge. I think that would have been the best and the kids can fight it out later! Sadly it is not going to happen.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to the on-screen drama, the series was hit with a scandal behind-the-scenes in December 2017, when showrunner and creator <a href=#><strong>Mark Schwahn</strong></a> was <a href=#>fired following allegations</a> of sexual harassment.</p><p>Hurley <a href=#>spoke out about the allegations</a> at the time, saying she was “devastated” to hear the reports, but “never personally felt scared or intimidated” by Schwahn and “never witnessed it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyloaqWr6bAx2afrqqcmsZuvsSvnJqko2K1pr6MnamemZ1isq%2BwyKeeZp6fp3q1tMRmqaixkaHAcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./albert-roux-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Albert Roux Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./judge-kevin-ross-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Judge Kevin Ross Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-summers-eve-wash-bad-for-you-html.html>Is Summer's Eve Wash Bad For You?
